# primetime

Calculates primes in different modes as well as different methods.

**Methods:**
- Brute Force
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (extended)

**Modes:**
- Range (min-max)  
  Define a range between primes should be calculated

- Count (start, count)  
  Define a start point and a number of primes that should be calculated from there.  
  **Only works with Brute Force**

It also allows to output the primes to a file 'primes.txt' with a row counter
